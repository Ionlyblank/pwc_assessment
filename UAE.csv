                            There are several tools and methods to implement ePayment for government services. 
 
Payment cards for transportaion
Hafilat card
In Abu Dhabi, you can pay for public bus fares by Hafilat card. You need to load it with money and swipe it before and after every trip. The fare is calculated automatically based on the distance of the passenger's journey. Weekly and monthly passes are also available. 
 
Mawaqif 
In Abu Dhabi, you can pay for public parking fares by Mawaqif card. These cards also need to be pre-loaded with currency and swiped at the parking fees’ kiosk for getting a ticket. These cards are rechargeable. 
 
Nol card
In Dubai, you can pay for all public transport including bus, metro, waterbus, water taxi, abras, tram and even for public parking with Nol card. Nol is a smart card. You can add certain balance or recharge it via the RTA’s applications or at the smart kiosks present at bus and metro stations. Check the types of Nol card and how to obtain them. 
 
In addition, there is a Smart Nol card which enables payments through NFC.
 
Sayer card
In Sharjah, you can pay for public bus fares by Sayer card. You can get Sayer card from the vending machine at Jubail Bus Terminal or from the driver on the Mowasalat buses.
 
RTA eWallet
In May 2013, Roads and Transport Authority launched eWallet; it's an online account through which one can make secure online payment.
 
RFID
Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is in use to levy road toll Salik in Dubai since July 2007. You do not need to stop your car at any toll point to pay the road toll. When your vehicle passes through a Salik toll point, RFID scans the Salik tag attached to your vehicle windshield, which is connected to your prepaid Salik toll account and automatically deducts the toll amount. 
 
Credit and debit cards
Government service providers accept credit cards as a means of payment for service provided to the public. You can pay by credit card via counters or online to get the government service. Most banks in the UAE enable their customers to pay government fees directly through direct debit from bank accounts instead of credit cards.
 
Electronic kiosks 
Several government service providers install electronic kiosks in malls, business centres and other public places for payment of bills and other service charges. To pay via electronic kiosks, you need to provide account details and follow the steps required to finish the transaction."

 In addition, TDRA is collaborating with both Etisalat and du, the internet service providers in the UAE, and with the local eGovernments to develop the telecommunications sector and spread the usage of IPV6 on their networks in the country, which have a prominent impact on the economic and social growth.



TDRA, represented by the .ae Domain Administration Department established the UAE top-level domain infrastructure to comply with the IPv6. The .ae and the Arabic top-level domain (.Emarat) registry system are currently capable of assigning IPv6 Domain Name System delegation to their customers who wish to serve their websites through the IPv6 cloud.

                            GSB started with the commissioning phase with ten entities at the federal level. Entities, which participated in this phase, include:

    
    Ministry of Community Development
    
    
    General Pension and Social Security Authority
    
    
    Ministry of Health and Prevention
    
    
    Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation 
    
    
    Ministry of Interior 
    
    
    Ministry of Energy & Infrastructure
    
    
    Ministry of Justice
    
    
    Ministry of Education
    
    
    Ministry of Economy
    
    
    Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
    

During the trial phase, federal entities implemented the GSB successfully. The project received interest and support of the federal and local government entities. The trial phase included a connection between GSB and Institutional Service Bus established by Abu Dhabi Systems and Information Center. Consequently, Abu Dhabi Retirement Pensions and Benefits Fund could join the project in the trial phase.
The project contributes to the enhancement of government efficiency and service quality. During the commissioning phase, it provided 15 ancillary services to improve 10 main services provided by federal and local entities participating in the trial phase. Efficiency was reflected in saving 57,831 customer visits and 7,460 employee workdays per year (equal to the work of 30 employees per year). These numbers will be doubled after other government entities join the project and enlist their services.
8 government entities, including 6 federal entities and 2 local entities had joined GSB by April 2017. 11 services are completely connected to the GSB service.

                            Below are some of the features of the UAE Pass app:

    Use of face recognition technology (facial ID)
    The UAE Pass app uses biometric face recognition (facial ID) to register users. This helps to create a verified account in less than 5 minutes without having to visit government services centres for verification. Before the facial ID system was implemented, the registration process took 20 minutes and registrants had to visit government services centres to complete the verification process.
    
     
    
    Ability to store and share digital documents 
    The UAE Pass has a feature to store and share digital documents through the digital vault, without the need to provide paper documents. 
     
    You can request for a digital version of your official documents and use them securely, to get services from service providers when needed. The digital vault is powered by blockchain technology, providing you with optimal traceability and security. 
     
    
    Ability to sign documents digitally
    The UAE Pass has a feature to sign documents digitally. You can either upload and then sign a document on the app or on the UAE Pass website, or sign a virtual document to complete an official transaction. And, if someone shares a signed document with you, you can instantly verify it on the app or even on the UAE Pass website.
    
    

 
In addition, the UAE Pass offers the ability to:
4. sign in to services through a single mobile–based login
5. update your profile information
6. update your address records."

Read about laws, policies and platforms related to open government data.","","","Benefits of open government data and guidelines
                            What is open government data?
Government data that is freely available for anyone to use, reuse, distribute or share with others without restrictions is called open government data. As per the UN eGovernment Survey 2018 (PDF, 2 MB), open government data is government information proactively disclosed and made available online for all to access, without restriction.
 
Benefits of open government data
Disclosing government data brings transparency in government transactions and makes them accountable for their actions. It facilitates public scrutiny and evaluation of government performance. Open data helps in efficient use of resources, designing customised service delivery and creation of more jobs. It helps people to make informed decisions about public policies and identify development opportunities. Through all its endeavours, open government data helps to achieve the SDGs.
 
A document issued by World Bank (PDF, 1.5 MB) estimates the direct, annual economic value of open government data in two different studies as up to 40 billion euros throughout the European Union and close to 2 billion pounds in the UK. 
 
Increasingly many countries have launched an open data portal. In 2014, just 46 countries had an open data portal. However, in 2018, 139 countries had an open data portal as per the UN eGovernment Survey 2018. 
The UAE has two data portals: UAE Numbers and Bayanat.
 
The World Bank document brings out the key benefits of open data which are:

    Fostering in economic growth and job creation.
    Open data can promote economic growth by helping launch new businesses, create new jobs, increase efficiency in existing organisations and generally improve the climate for foreign investment. 
     
    
    Improving efficiency, effectiveness and coverage of public services
    Open data can help strengthen healthcare systems by connecting patients to providers, promote education and ongoing learning, and relieve hunger and improve food security on both a large and small scale. 
     
    
    Increasing transparency, accountability and citizen participation
    Open data can expose and prevent mismanagement and corruption. It also helps ensure environmental sustainability through transparent data that can help reduce pollution, conserve natural resources, and build resilience to climate change.
     
    
    Facilitating better information sharing within the government 

Open data can help improve cities and urban infrastructure. It is key to high-tech smart cities, modern urban planning and the transformation of urban transportation. It can also improve resilience to disasters and ensure that critical resources will be deployed well in emergencies.

Data Change Management Framework
The Dubai Data Change Management Framework provides a practical structure to facilitate transition within the Dubai government. Through a change plan guide, the Dubai Data Manual and supportive toolkits, the Change Management Framework will enable the growth of an effective and sustainable open and shared data culture.
 
Open Data Guidelines
The purpose of Open Data Guidelines is to guide the governmental bodies (ministries, agencies, Councils, etc.) what they are required to adhere to when they follow the Open data policy on their website. The scope of this document is limited to the websites of government agencies in the United Arab Emirates. As the document is open for continuous development, its scope can be expanded as dictated by the public policy of the Government of the United Arab Emirates and related instructions.

                            Federal Law No. 3 of 2021 Concerning the Regulation of Fundraising Activities ( PDF, 3.89 MB) aims to regulate the fund-raising activities and donations for charities in the UAE. It pronounces the rules for charitable donations and governs the functioning of non-profit organisations. It applies to any association that wants to collect or provide donations in the country, on the mainland and in free zones. The law aims to protect fund-raisers and their funds from the risks of exploitation in financing terrorism and illegal organisations. 
 
Who can raise funds?
Fund-raising activity, whether it is carried out through traditional or digital methods, is restricted to entities classified by law as charitable and humanitarian organisations and to government and non-government public interest institutions whose decrees, laws, or resolutions of establishment confirm that they may conduct such activities.
According to the law, natural persons are not allowed to host, organise or carry out any fund-raising activity.
 
 
How to raise funds?
Any non-profit association that wishes to raise any type of donations in the UAE, must first obtain a licence from Ministry of Community Development or a competent authority in each emirate. Additionally, fund-raising must be done through one of the licensed charities or humanitarian organisations in the UAE. Also, the applicant must:

    get the approval from the respective charity 
    state the objectives of the fund-raising 
    list the names and present the ID’s of the persons in charge of the operation
    mention the beneficiaries 
    list the places where fund-raising will be carried out.

 
Penalty for raising funds through unauthorised means

                            The UAE's aid has only humanitarian objectives. It is neither governed by politics nor is not limited by geography, race, colour or religion of the beneficiary. This is a practical application of the principle of tolerance and co-existence in the UAE. This policy was laid down by the founder President of the UAE, the late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan who stressed that foreign aid and assistance is one of the basic pillars of UAE foreign policy.

When formulating its approach to providing foreign aid, the UAE has adopted the idea of sustainable development and improving the welfare of all mankind.

In order to consolidate the impact of its foreign aid, the UAE Cabinet has formed the 'UAE Humanitarian Committee', which aims to channel and combine the collective expertise of UAE humanitarian responders in order to facilitate, oversee and coordinate the country's humanitarian aid."

The 'UAE's Foreign Aid in 2015' report issued by Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation mentioned that the UAE provided AED 32.34 billion (USD 8.8 billion) in foreign aid during 2015. This contribution was made as foreign assistance to 155 countries through 40 donor entities. Of the 155 countries, 120 were eligible to receive Official Development Assistance (ODA). 
 
The UAE spends its foreign aid on developmental projects, humanitarian aid and charitable aid. In 2015, the majority of the aid (92 per cent) was disbursed to development projects, with 6.7 per cent disbursed to humanitarian aid and 1.3 per cent disbursed to charitable assistance. 
 
The foreign aid targets priority areas such as: humanitarian assistance, elimination of poverty, support for children, global sectoral programmes such as transportation, infrastructure, governments support and empowerment of women. During 2015, most humanitarian aid was allocated to refugees and internally displaced people affected by crises and conflicts in Syria, Yemen and Iraq.
 
According to geographical distribution, countries in Africa got the largest aid of AED 25.11 billion. Asian countries received AED 6.63 billion. Countries in Europe, North and South America, Oceania and others received AED 586.94 million. 
 
The UAE's foreign aid in 2015 was in line with the country's policy of supporting the UN Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The UAE is currently involved in the efforts to achieve UN SDGs.

Affiliated bodies under MBRGI are classified as per the five main pillars.","","","Achievements of MBRGI so far
                            In the area of combating poverty and disease:

The UAE observes that the prevalence of severe poverty in a number of countries and regions across the world is the result of several factors some of which are deeply rooted because of poor international response and the absence of a comprehensive vision to address the issue. The UAE has become a role model in this respect due to its commitment to achieving the objectives of the Millennium Development Goals, which prioritise poverty eradication.

Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Global Initiatives not only provide aid but also combat the root causes of poverty and disease worldwide. Their programmes have assisted 40 million people in 99 countries by 2015.

With regard to eradicating poverty specifically, MBRGI and its affiliated bodies have given financial and practical support to more than 1.5 million households in 40 countries. They constructed the largest infrastructure and logistics system in the world on an area of 700,000 square feet to provide facilities and services for charitable and humanitarian institutions. Between 2011 and 2014, the UAE donated 8.9billion AED to eradicate poverty worldwide.

In the fight against the spread of disease, their programmes have prevented and treated blindness for 23 million people and provided 81 million vaccines and medications in the past eight years. They have protected 3.6 million children in vulnerable countries from intestinal worms, which threaten their health and future. They have also built 46 hospitals.

According to the UAEInteract website, between 1971 and 2014, the UAE spent 2billion AED on projects associated with children's health, education and relief efforts in Asia and Africa. Some of these programmes involved vaccinating children against polio and measles with a special focus on Pakistani and Afghanistani children.

In the area of spreading knowledge:

In spreading knowledge in other countries, Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Global Initiatives and its affiliated bodies seek to support education, disseminate knowledge, encourage the research and spread of knowledge, and provide children with healthy learning environment free of disease and its causes.

The initiatives in this sector have been responsible for the construction 2,126 schools around the world, training 400,000 teachers, distributing and printing more than 3.2 million books, translating 1,000 knowledge-based books, encouraging millions of students in the Arab world to read 50 million books a year and sustaining Arabic language support initiatives.

In 2016, the initiative of  Reading Nation  was launched. It was a Ramadan campaign aiming at collecting, printing and distributing 5 million books from the UAE to the world. The campaign was launched under the direction of H. H. Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum in partnership with MBRGI, Dubai Cares and the Emirates Red Crescent.

In the area of empowering communities:

Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum Global Initiatives holds conferences and grants awards to innovative individuals in the fields of media, art and sports. To date, half a million people have been touched through these initiatives; 67,000 of them are media personnel who have contributed to opening new horizons for media in the region. The Foundation is further concerned with consolidating a cultural discourse characterised by tolerance through investing half a billion AED in cultural understanding initiatives, which have benefited more than 200 nationalities.

In the area of entrepreneurship and innovation for the future:

The UAE is a regional leader in encouraging entrepreneurship and pioneering innovation. The UAE Government stresses on these as essential keys to sustainable progress. In the recent past, the visionary leaders of the UAE have announced several initiatives and policies in these fields. The UAE recognises industrialisation as the key to economic development.

In the area of spreading entrepreneurship and innovation, Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Global Initiatives and its affiliated bodies aim to train officials and leaders from 155 governmental organisations from various countries around the world, in order to develop the governmental mindset and raise the level of public services. In addition, it has also invested AED 1 billion to create an integrated environment to serve creative innovators locally, regionally and globally through the Museum of the Future."

                            Sheikh Khalifa ordered the establishment of the debts settlement fund on 2 December 2011, the occasion of the 40th National Day with an initial allocation of AED 10 billion, to help heavily indebted Emiratis settle their loans.

In 2014, the number of beneficiaries whose debts were dropped amounted to 3,482 citizens and the total value of the waived amount touched AED 1.5 billion.

The beneficiaries fell under the category of 'committed to pay' in addition to the cases of social security, health disability or special needs and a number of humanitarian cases.

The national banks that had waived the debts included Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, First Gulf Bank, Mashreq Bank, Union Bank, National Bank of Abu Dhabi, Emirates National Bank Dubai, Hilal Bank and National Bank of Umm Al Quwain.

 
How does the Debt Settlement Fund work?

Banks write off half of the outstanding amount and the other half is bailed out by the government. Banks then collect the money from their customers and pass it back to the government. Those who are helped by the fund are banned from borrowing any more money from banks in the UAE until the obligation is settled.

Only Emiratis are eligible to apply if their loans are the subject of litigation brought before a specific date. An Emirati who has been taken to court by a bank before 2 December, 2011 can apply.

                            The Emirates Polio Campaign for polio eradication was made under the directives of the late H. H. Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed AI Nahyan, the then President of the UAE in support of health-care programmes in Pakistan to bring epidemics under control and deflect the health hazards on the children in the affected areas.

The effort is part of the UAE Government's 2013 pledge of AED 440 million for supporting global efforts to put the world over the finish line for polio eradication by 2018, with a focus on Pakistan, which has one of world's highest rates of polio infection.

Through the Emirates Polio campaign, the UAE has provided 116,177,794 million  polio vaccines  for Pakistani children aged under five from January 2014 to the end of May 2016.

The Emirates Polio Campaign supports the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) of WHO's General Assembly for eradicating polio by the end of 2018 and the Pakistani Government's National Emergency Action Plan to wipe out the polio virus.

In 2011, H. H. Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces and Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Bill Gates, Co-Chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, committed USD 100 million (USD 50 million each) for the purchase and delivery of vital vaccines to prevent diseases and save the lives of Afghani and Pakistani children.

                            National Programme for Happiness and Well-Being launched a Guide to Happiness and Well-being at workplace. 
 
The purpose of the guide is to help government entities and other stakeholders in the private sector and non-profit organisations discover how to foster the conditions necessary for employees to thrive and flourish at work in terms of productivity and engagement. 
 
The employee’s happiness at workplace is critical because it is often directly reflected in the quality and volume of services an institution offers to its customers.
 
An emphasis on happiness and well-being raises morale across an organisation, boosts engagement at work and builds trust and loyalty among colleagues and between the employees and the institution itself.
 
The guide outlines four fundamental pillars that underpin the development of a positive workplace culture which is supportive of happiness and wellbeing. Read about the Guide to Happiness and Well-being at workplace."

                            Traditionally, the Emiratis engaged in  falconry  and racing horses, camels,  salukis  and dhows as a way of survival. However, with changing times and laws these activities are now practised purely as a regulated sport.

Falconry

At the end of the annual hunting season, falcons undergo medical check-ups at the  Abu Dhabi Falcon Hospital  and only the healthy birds are let into the wild. Others are treated at the hospital. Each falcon is micro-chipped for identification and protection.

Equestrian sports

Equestrian sports in the UAE include endurance, show jumping, eventing, dressage and racing. The late H. H. Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan started endurance rides in the UAE. Even today, several members of the royal families in the UAE passionately pursue equestrian sports.

Both H. H. Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum and his son H. H. Sheikh Hamdan are exceptionally gifted endurance riders and have won several international endurance rides. H. H. Sheikh Mohammed owns the  Godolphin  stable in Dubai and runs  Darley, the global thoroughbred breeding operation from the United Kingdom.

Camel racing

Camel racing was mainly staged to mark important social occasions such as wedding ceremonies, community festivals or the visits of Sheikhs to Bedouin villages. Today, it is an organised sport involving valuable prizes and cash awards worth millions of Dirhams.

The local breed - Mahaliyat, the Omani breed - Omaniyat, the Sudanese camels - Sudaniyat and the interbred - Muhajanat are the main breeds used in the racing competitions.

Bull-fighting

 Bull-fighting  still takes place in the emirate of Fujairah. It is a weekly activity practised during the cooler months."

The letter can be submitted to court at any time within three months from the date of issue. Once in court, the particulars of the divorce case fall at the court's discretion and each party has to provide evidence to support own claims against one another as well as in their own defence."

Article 1 of the  Federal Law No 28 of 2005 for Personal Affairs, as amended states: The provisions of this Law shall apply on citizens of the United Arab Emirates State unless non-Muslims among them have special provisions applicable to their community or confession. They shall equally apply to non-citizens unless one of them asks for the application of his law. This means that relevant parties may ask to apply their own laws to personal status matters.
It also provides: The law of the state of which the husband is a national at the time the marriage is contracted shall apply to the effects on personal status and the effects with regards to property resulting from contracting of the marriage.
Whenever the law of the parties' home country fails to cover an aspect of the divorce procedure, the courts hold discretion to apply the UAE law."

Parties will need to draft a settlement based on the parties’ mutual understanding and sign it before the conciliator.","","","Children's custody
                            According to  Federal Law No 28 of 2005 for Personal Affairs, the biological mother of the child is the custodian and the father is the guardian. Custody involves day-to-day care of the child, which is usually granted to the mother without interfering with the right of guardianship awarded to the father.

At all times, the father is responsible for providing for the child financially. He is responsible for providing shelter, expenses for food, medical care, education and other necessities.
Custody and guardianship are two separate issues that must be addressed individually as parents do not share equal responsibilities for a child in the UAE. 


The courts always act in the best interests of the child and therefore, unless given reason to believe otherwise, they keep him in the physical custody of the mother, whilst being under the guardian's (father's) supervision.

Article 156 of  Federal Law No 28 of 2005 for Personal Affairs  provides that a child's custody under the mother ends when their son reaches the age of 11 and when their daughter reaches the age of 13. The father being the guardian can claim the custody thereafter.
As set out in Article 143 and 144 of the law, a custodian must be:


    Rational
    
    Mature enough and have attained the age of puberty
    
    Honest
    
    Able to bring up and take care of a child
    
    Free from infectious disease
    
    Not have been sentenced for a crime of 'honour'.
    

If the custodian is the mother, she must:


    Not remarry unless the court decides it's in the best interests of the child
    
    Share the same religion as the child.
    

If the custodian is the father, he must:


    Have a suitable woman living in his home to care for the child (such as a female relative)
    
    Share the same religion as the child.
    

The mother also has the right to claim the extension of the custody period until their son finishes his education and their daughter gets married. In this case, the mother has to prove that she has been good with the children i.e. through their school performance reports, good medical health history etc.

The father can claim the custody of their son if he feels that their son is becoming too soft in nature by staying with the mother and that he would want him to grow up to be more responsible. In both circumstances, the judge will decide the case."

                            A custodian cannot travel with the child without the guardian's approval and vice-versa. Fleeing with the child without the consent of the other parent, could amount to child abduction. The parent abducting the child can face serious legal consequences for such action. If either parent has concerns, they can obtain a travel ban preventing the child from leaving the airport. If there is a dispute, the matter can be referred to a judge."

                            The UAE Government sees young people as its greatest assets; the foundation of the country’s future. In 2016, H. H. Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Prime Minister and Vice President of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, committed to putting young people’s needs and desires at the fore, by creating the position of Minister of State for Youth Affairs – a dedicated post that showed the government’s confidence in young people’s capabilities.
 
This enabled the youth to shoulder national responsibilities, innovate and contribute to the welfare of the UAE's community. To achieve its vision,  the UAE needs the skills, energy, enthusiasm and commitment of the country's young people, and to do that, young people’s voices must be heard, their ideas taken on, and their recommendations implemented at all government levels. 
 
The government took seriously the potential advantages of harnessing the ‘youth bulge’ in the UAE and in the region, appointing one of the youngest ministers in the world, nominated by universities from across the country. To place a young person at the helm of such an important government department was a vote of confidence in this generation’s ability to lead effectively."

                            The UAE’s National Youth Strategy looks at the five major transitions in a youth’s life in a 20-year span.  
From ages 15-35, youth transition through these critical stages: 

    Education
    Work
    Adopting a healthy and safe lifestyle
    Starting a family 
    Exercising their citizenship.  

FYA invests in youth’s energy, our most valuable resource, by nurturing their character, developing an enabling environment for their growth and development, and maximising their participation.
FYA uses the metaphor of a plant to illustrate their strategy:

    Character in young people is like the roots of a tree, it influences everything we do. Every action, attitude and belief we take is first rooted in our character. This means that the attitudes, beliefs and choices of our youth shape our nation and our world. Character matters the most.
    The UAE is on a mission to cultivate character in youth that builds on our core values of inclusion, tolerance, family and commitment to excellence.
    The stem of the plant is the enabling environment. We provide both, a tangible and intangible environment in terms of physical spaces and enabling government policies for youth. 
    We believe that when we invest in youth, it is similar to watering the plants and providing them with sunlight and good soil. Youth will participate by sharing their talents and skills back into the country, which will build the foundation for the next 50 years of the UAE’s development."

                            The UAE Government designed many policies to make the youth take part in every sector and at all levels of governance and decision-making, and to infuse them into the national strategy as key stakeholders and actors in the country’s development.
Youth Engagement Policy
The UAE’s mandate is to institutionalise the whole youth sector. The UAE has made big bets on youth and believes that engaging them is the fundamental component to success in the next 50 years of development. 
 
FYA is therefore part of spearheading the Engagement policy to include the voice of the youth in everything we do. Engaging youth means three core things:

    Engagement is listening 
    Engagement is data capturing
    Engagement is purposeful, inclusive and puts youth and their input as the core of the country’s development strategy. 

 
The UAE engages youth at regional (through the Arab Youth Centre), national and local levels. It engages its youth in all matters, and it can be evidenced in the policies and initiatives below. 


Emirati Youth Board Membership 
In June 2019, the UAE Cabinet made it mandatory for federal government entities to include young Emiratis (under 30 years old) in the Boards of Directors of their respective entities. It launched an electronic platform for those interested to register and apply to these boards, and on 3rd February 2020, Cabinet approved the appointment of 33 applicants as members of the Boards of Directors for key federal entities. 
 
The young board members serve two to three-year terms and undergo intensive training. They enjoy similar privileges and benefits as other established board members. The new members are expected to provide creative solutions for national issues and to ensure that youth are given opportunities and that their challenges are resolved at every level.
 
Youth Councils
In 2017, the UAE government developed Youth Councils as a unique tool to ensure that the youth represent their points of view and needs at all stages of the policy development process. 
 
Youth Councils were launched with an aim to nurture young leaders by giving them a key role in decision-making and in the development of policies and projects. They provide a platform for youth to lead projects in their field or their emirate. The ecosystem of the Youth Councils is crucial to implementing and executing the UAE’s National Youth Strategy. 
 
There are five Youth Councils which serve as the central form of volunteer governance over many of the Youth initiatives and points of engagement:
● Emirates Youth Council (EYC)
● Local Youth Councils (LYC)
● Global Youth Councils (GYC)
● Inter-Ministerial Councils (IMC)
These function as the representative arms of youth across the UAE’s specific ministries. 
 
● Corporate Councils 
These function as the representative arms of youth across the UAE’s private and public sector enterprises. 



Youth Participation in Official Delegations policy
In February 2020, the UAE approved the 'Youth Participation in Official Delegations' policy, which ensures the representation of young employees in all UAE official delegations.
 
Objectives:

    building leaders in the diplomatic field
    integrating a youth perspective into the UAE's international delegations
    activating the youth's role on a global scale
    designing a framework that supports youth representation
    Showcasing the character of UAE youth on the international scene
    promoting the UAE's soft power and highlighting the government's engagement with youth.

  
The Youth Housing Policy
On 2 June 2020, the UAE Cabinet approved the Youth Housing Awareness Policy to raise youth awareness and provide them with a host of information on the various phases of housing construction.
 
The policy requires all young applicants (from 18 to 35 years) to complete a training course on the foundations of housing construction as a main requirement to apply for housing assistance at the local and federal level in the UAE.
 
Federal Youth Authority also developed a ‘Housing 101’ course, which provides instructions on the how to build a house – from conception to construction.

                            Youth Circles 
Designed by and for the youth, Youth Circles provide two-way dialogues directly between the youth and our government, private sector and global leaders. 
 
Youth Circles are affordable, accessible and fully community-led. Organised periodically throughout different global locations, the aim of Youth Circles is to develop practical solutions, innovative ideas and effective policies and tangibly connect Youth to leadership.
 
In Youth Circles, youth share their ideas, needs, challenges and dreams. Leaders listen, hold a dialogue and take action. Each event addresses a specific topic and the young participants try to come up with solutions and ideas through discussions and recommendations. 
 
Youth Hubs 
Youth Hubs are state-of-the-art spaces done by the youth, for the youth. They are collaborative work and convening spaces that connect young people throughout the UAE with the essential resources and ecosystem for growth. 
 
The mission of Youth Hub is to provide world-class resources for the youth to explore their purpose in life and pursue their potential and thrive. Resources include both, facilities and courses in various skills designed to bring out their potential. 
Youth Hubs are located across all the UAE and are open to young people between 15 and 35 years irrespective of whether they are students, employees or entrepreneurs.
 
The first Youth Hub opened in Dubai in September 2017 in order to connect youth in the areas of: 

    job creation and economic growth 
    education and lifelong learning 
    innovation and entrepreneurship 
    mentoring and partnerships and 
    health and wellness. 

 
There are currently 13 Youth Hubs around the UAE. Each Youth Hub is distinctly designed to serve the youth of that emirate, accommodating their needs and aspirations."

                            In 2017, the UAE launched the Arab Youth Center (AYC) during the World Government Summit 2017. AYC is a regional youth centre in the UAE that helps to develop youth capabilities and supports innovation and creativity in the Arab world. It implements initiatives across different sectors, and conducts research amongst young Arabs to help decision-makers shape youth-friendly policies. 
 
AYC runs over 25 initiatives every year, connecting the youth to industry professionals, opening doors for them in the academic world, helping them build their businesses and much more. 
 
For the ninth year in a row, the UAE is the Arab youth's first choice for living, according to the Arab Youth Survey 2020. The UAE recognises the importance of equipping not just its own youth, but also the youth within the region. The success of the region lies in its youth, and the UAE is working closely with young Arabs to make sure their contributions to their countries have a ripple effect across borders and well into the future."

                            Empowerment of women in the UAE had started in 8 February 1973 when the first women's meeting in the UAE, 'The Renaissance of Abu Dhabi Women Association' was held. The foundation of similar associations began in other emirates. Sheikha Fatima Bint Mubarak envisioned the need to cope with the unitary ideology of her husband, the late Sheikh Zayed who was the Founding Father of the UAE and established General Women's Union in 1975 joining all women associations in the UAE.
Since then, the UAE has implemented a number of initiatives for the economic empowerment of women in the UAE. In December 2012, the Government issued a decision on the mandatory membership of Emirati women in the Boards of Directors of federal bodies, companies and institutions.
 
Women in the workforce
As of 2015,  women occupy 66 per cent of public sector jobs, one of the highest proportions worldwide. 30 per cent occupy senior leadership positions associated with decision-making roles.
Women in the UAE participate actively in the private sector in various roles including that of entrepreneurs and managers. According to another report published in November 2015 in WAM, there are 21,000 women employers in the UAE.
Women in the UAE have equal rights to economic resources, as well as access to ownership and control over land and other forms of property, financial services, inheritance and natural resources, in accordance with national laws. Women business-owners account for 10 per cent of the total private sector in the UAE. They run projects worth more than AED 40 billion and constitute 15 per cent of the members of the boards of directors of the Chambers of Commerce and Industry.
 
National Strategy for Empowerment of Emirati Women
On 8 March 2015, Sheikha Fatima bint Mubarak, the Chairwoman of General Women's Union (GWU) launched the National Strategy for Empowerment of Emirati Women in the UAE for 2015-2021 (WAM). The strategy provides a framework for government, private sector and civil society organisations to establish work plans to position the UAE among the most advanced countries in the area of women's empowerment.
The strategy contains four basic priorities:

    maintaining the sustainability of the Emirati women's achievements and continue achieving further gains
    maintaining the social fabric and cohesion through integrating the roles between men and women in order to build a strong and cohesive society able to cope with emerging changes
    providing a decent and safe social welfare based on high quality foundations for women
    developing the spirit of responsibility and strengthening the position of the UAE's women in regional and international fora.

                            Local municipalities in the UAE are responsible for managing, disposing and treatment of wastewater. To match with the steep rise in sewage generation as a direct effect of increase in the UAE's population, the government is investing in upgrading and extending sewer systems to ensure a sustainable sewage disposal and treatment system. Some of these projects are mentioned below by emirate.
Abu Dhabi

In Abu Dhabi, Sustainable Water Solutions Holding Company - (SWS Holding) is in charge of collecting and treating waste-water discharged from all residential and commercial customers. In 2009, SWS  launched an AED 5.7 billion (USD 1.6 billion)  Strategic Tunnel Enhancement Programme (STEP), which includes building 41 km of deep sewer tunnels.

In 2014, an ambitious environmental plan was revealed to treat and re-use all of the emirate's wastewater to irrigate farms and parks within four years.

Dubai

Dubai is planning to get a new deep tunnel sewerage system costing AED 12.5 billion in the next five years, to replace more than 121 sewerage pumping stations. The new deep tunnel system makes use of gravity for the collection of sewage.

In addition, a project to expand the Jebel Ali sewerage plant has been approved and will cost AED 1.3 billion. When it is completed, it will serve 1.35 million people and will bring the plant's capacity to 675,000 cubic metres daily, which is double its current capacity.

Sharjah
Sharjah Municipality opened a new underground sewerage treatment plant in April 2012 to cater for residential areas, in addition to the AED 227 million sewerage treatment plant at Al Sajaa area. The main sewerage treatment plant at the fifth industrial area will undergo an expansion to increase its capacity from 30, 000 cubic metres to 50,000 cubic metres daily.

 
Ajman
Ajman had its first sewerage treatment network in 2009, which was built by Ajman Sewage Company, one of the first sewage projects' PPPs in the region.
 
Ras Al Khaimah
In Ras Al Khaimah, Public Services Department handles management of wastewater. Following urbanisation, local governments are investing in upgrading and extensions of sewer systems.

                            Zayed International Airport Expansion

The 700,000-square metre terminal building is one of the key projects in Abu Dhabi and the UAE, to develop a world-class air transportation hub. The  Midfield Terminal Building (MTB) represents one of the largest investments by the UAE to deliver the needed infrastructure, in line with Abu Dhabi Plan 2030, that will cater to the growth of the aviation sector in the region and confirms Abu Dhabi's strong position in the global air transportation network.

It will initially handle 27 to 30 million passengers per year once operational and cater to Abu Dhabi's Etihad Airways and the carriers it holds stakes in.

The MTB design focuses on passenger experience, highest quality and service standards, including the International Air Transport Association's 'A' level of service which is the highest levels of space allocation for passenger processing areas. The design targets to achieve 'Two Pearl Rating', in line with the 'Estidama' approach towards sustainable design.

Operational highlights include:


    Piers would accommodate up to 65 aircraft, including the Airbus A-380
    
    Check-in facilities would be capable of handling around 8,500 passengers per hour
    
    Check-in facilities would include 165 conventional counters and 48 self-service kiosks
    
    Airline lounges would cover 30,000 square metres
    
    Parking areas would accommodate 3,400 cars for short term and 1,500 cars for long term
    
    Retail (including food and beverage) space would cover 28,000 square metres

                            The Ramadan traditions in the UAE start mid-Shaaban (the month preceding Ramadan). This day is known as Hagg Al-Layla. Emirati children dress in their best clothes and go to houses in the neighbouring areas reciting songs and poems. The neighbours welcome them with sweets and nuts, which is collected by children in traditional cloth bags.
 
There are two main meals in Ramadan: Suhoor and Iftar. Suhoor is consumed early in the morning before sunrise, just before fasting hours start. Iftar is the meal to break the fast. Following the example of the Prophet Muhammad, fasting is broken with dates and laban (buttermilk) throughout the Islamic world.
 
On the first night of Ramadan, the family gathers at the house of the male head of the family, usually the grandfather, for their first Iftar. In the UAE and the other GCC countries, dates are considered as the 'bread of the desert'. Gars, a bread-like crumble with dates and cardamom, is a popular Emirati sweet dish during Ramadan. Other common dishes are Harees and Threed. Read about where you can eat Emirati food.
 



Firing the cannon (Midfa Al Iftar) is an integral part of the Islamic culture and takes place in many regions across the country. It can be heard around 8-10 km away. It signals the moment when Muslims can break their fast. This tradition is known to people since the rule of the late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the Founder President of the UAE. Children wait for the sound of the big bang. To them, Iftar cannon is the most fun thing that happens during this month, apart from the sweets and other special meals and activities arranged for them. Members of the UAE military carry out this tradition with appropriate safety precautions.
 
Those who suffer certain barrier such as illness or pregnancy are not obligated to fast as per health professionals' advice. Those who were travelling may fast later. Children are not required to fast until they have reached puberty, although many still do out of choice. In addition to abstaining from eating, drinking and smoking, Muslims also should refrain from sinful speech and behaviour. 
 
In addition to the regular 5 daily prayers, Muslim men and women perform Tarawih prayers daily after Isha prayers in mid-evening. During the last ten days, many devoted Muslims spend the whole day in mosques, praying and reciting the Quran, in anticipation of the Laylat Al Qadr, the night of the first revelation of the Quran. Reciting different chapters each day from the Quran is appreciated throughout the month of Ramadan. Observing Ramadan provides a spiritual experience. It is the time for Muslims to practice self-discipline, sacrifice and empathy for the less fortunate. It encourages generosity and charity."

                            The UAE hosts many interesting events to celebrate the holy month of Ramadan and the spirit of togetherness, charity and family cohesion that it brings along. Look for various social and cultural events during Ramadan in Abu Dhabi and Dubai. Find out more in the events section.
 
Social and religious events
General Authority of Islamic Affairs and Endowments and other Islamic entities in each emirate conduct a number of religious lectures and sermons at various mosques across the country. Many world-renowned Islamic scholars are invited to enrich this spiritual month. 
 
Dubai International Holy Quran Award hosts an annual holy Quran memorisation contest. The entity also conducts lectures on Islam at various locations across the emirate. There are also the annual Holy Quran recital competitions for students and adults, where the winners earn cash prizes and more.
 
In addition, several educational and cultural are conducted that educate the public on what the month of Ramadan is all about and how to conduct oneself during this holy month.
 
Zakat Fund increases its campaigns during Ramadan to support and assist needy families as per its approved projects. The campaigns target:

    Awareness of the importance of Zakat among members of the society
     Introduction of the fatwa services, calculation of Zakat, and the various Zakat payment channels provided by Zakat Fund. 

 
Charitable activities 
Ramadan is a time for charity; giving to the less fortunate will be greatly appreciated. It doesn't have to be money, but perhaps food for Iftar. Providing free Iftar meals is a common practice across the UAE. Meals are provided at mosques, malls and other public places. 
 
Red Crescent Authority (RCA) and Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan Foundation  and other charitable organisations set up tents in various locations in the UAE to offer free Iftar meals. Setting up Ramadan tents is a fundamental practice in the UAE's tradition. It reflects the spirit of giving and sharing with people from different nationalities, social status and financial backgrounds who sit together to break their fast. Tents are usually seen near mosques, in open spaces and at the entrances of some Emiratis' houses. One can experience Emirati hospitality and traditions at these tents. 
 
Many public and private organisations distribute boxes of meals, dates and water at mosques and malls daily shortly before Iftar time. They also provide foodstuff (called Al Mir Al Ramadani) to cater to the poor.
 
RCA provides Ramadan supplies, distributes Zakat Al Fitr and Eid clothing to deserving families in the UAE and abroad. Individuals, companies and organisations interested in contributing to Red Crescent Society can do so through their counters located at mosques, shopping malls, hospitals and other public places.
 
 
You can donate clothes and money through registered charitable organisations by depositing them in designated boxes located at various public places. During Ramadan, many organisations set up tents near co-operative supermarkets for receiving donations.
 
Natural persons are not allowed to host, organise or carry out any fund-raising activity. Fund-raising must be done through one of the licensed charities or humanitarian organisations in the UAE.

                            During Ramadan, many co-operative stores and hypermarkets offer huge discounts on many essential commodities to ease the financial stress on families; some discounts are as much as up to 70 per cent. However, since the demand for essential commodities increases, some retailers take advantage of the situation. 
 
To avoid consumer exploitation and fraud, Ministry of Economy sets a cap on the price of essential commodities during the month. It ensures that wholesalers and retailers maintain enough stock of all essential commodities and undertakes inspection to ensure that retailers don't violate the regulations.

If the death certificate is in a language other than Arabic, such certificate should be translated legally into Arabic and then be attested by the embassy.

When the deceased arrives in the UAE, the mortuary section will handle further procedures such as embalming, burial etc.

                            According to Arton Capital's Passport Index, the UAE passport held the 1st position globally as of July 2023. A holder of the UAE’s passport could travel to 179 countries; 132 destinations offered visa-free travel and 47 offered eVisa or visa on arrival at the airport.
 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA) recently launched the UAE Passport Force initiative, with the view to place the State's passport on the list of the five most important passports in the world by 2021 upon the directives of Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Minister of Foreign Affairs.
 
The ranking was mainly boosted from its Schengen visa waiver obtained in 2015. The UAE is the first Arab nation whose citizens enjoy a visa waiver to the 26 Schengen countries, which make up most of Europe.

    The National Nutrition Guidelines

Ministry of Health and Prevention (MoHaP) launched the National Nutrition Guidelines (PDF, 2 MB) to serve as a unified national reference on food and nutrition education in the UAE’s community and health institutions. The guideline aims to:

    improve the nutritional status of the UAE’s community and raise awareness about healthy eating behaviour and lifestyle-related diseases
    reduce the prevalence of chronic and malnutrition diseases such as obesity, diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, anemia, osteoporosis and vitamin deficiency
    scale down non-communicable diseases and mortality rates
    encourage individuals to engage in physical activities for better health.

 
The guidelines consist of six guides. They are:

    to support and promote a healthy living system through healthy food and physical activity
    to maintain healthy food intake at all stages of life
    to reduce calories resulting from high sugar, saturated and trans fats and to reduce salt intake
    to eat variety of diet food and drinks that are rich in nutrients and high in nutritional intensity
    to adopt healthy food patterns
    to achieve food safety.

 
The National Nutrition Guidelines were developed in collaboration with the UAE’s Food and Water Security Office, the World Health Organization (WHO), the Gulf Nutrition Committee and the local government bodies across the UAE.

    No food may be imported into the country for the first time without approval of Ministry of Climate Change and Environment.
    Those dealing in food or products that contain pork or alcohol or any of their by-products without permission face a prison term of not less than a month and a fine of up to AED 500,000.
    Misleading consumers by publishing a false description of food or using incorrect labels will attract a fine ranging from AED 10,000 to 100,000.

 
The law authorises Ministry of Economy to impose fines of up to AED 100,000 for other offences, provided that these offences are regulated by the Cabinet. Through its National Food Safety Committee, the Ministry of Climate Change & Environment works with its partners on implementing the law on safety of food and its executive regulations, which includes strict controls and standards to ensure food safety throughout the food chain."

                            The UAE is a signatory to several international conventions on narcotic and psychotropic substances (PDF). The conventions involve applying internationally valid control measures to ensure that narcotic and psychotropic substances are not freely available to layman. The conventions aim to:


    make narcotic and psychotropic substances available only for medical and scientific purposes
    
    prevent their diversion into illicit channels
    
    eliminate drug trafficking and abuse.
    

Federal Law No. 14 of 1995 describes how these conventions are applied in the UAE and Federal Law No. 4 of 1983 describes the basic requirements for prescribing and supplying prescription medicines.

Controlled drugs are those that, if not used responsibly, can lead to addiction and have the potential to be abused by individuals. Narcotic and psychotropic (controlled drug - Class A or CDa) drugs are controlled. Controlled medicines are administered to patients of acute and chronic diseases in accordance with modern medical practice. They are mostly administered to in-patients.
Controlled drug - Class B (CDb) are semi-controlled.
Majority of medicines which are used worldwide are available in community pharmacies and hospitals in the UAE.
However, narcotic, psychotropic and other controlled drugs/medicines of class A or B are neither freely available in the UAE, nor can they be freely imported into the country. They fall under the controlled/restricted items' category.

You may bring in other prescribed medicines for personal use in normal quantity. To  import some medicines, you are required to receive permit from Ministry of Health and Prevention.
 
Prescription of controlled medicines

Narcotic prescriptions

In the emirate of Abu Dhabi, a narcotic can be prescribed only by a physician licensed by HAAD for an in-patient and must be written on the approved narcotic prescription form.

Private sector prescriptions for out-patient narcotic supply are not usually allowed. However, exceptions will be considered following a request from a medical director.
 
Psychotropic prescriptions

In the emirate of Abu Dhabi, a psychotropic for an out-patient can be prescribed only by a HAAD-licensed physician. There are special requirements for the psychotropics known as CDa, previously known as 'Registered Prescription (RP)' or 'Group 4' drugs.

These must be prescribed on the official psychotropic prescription form. Currently, there are UAE federal restrictions on the duration of prescription supply of CDa and CDb drugs and this depends upon the status of the prescribing physician.

In accordance with Federal Law No. 4 of 1983, there are special requirements for an out-patient prescription written for a CDa.

There are no special prescription-requirements for ordering psychotropic CDb drugs for in or out-patients and therefore these are ordered using a normal medical prescription. 
By prohibiting the use of drugs and restricting the use of controlled medicines, the UAE aims to strengthen the prevention and treatment of substance abuse, including narcotic drug abuse.

The Emirati Genome Programme is a national project which aims  to use genomic data to improve the health of the Emirati population. The project involves scientific study and research aimed at profiling and determining the gene sequencing among UAE Nationals to aid in the prevention and treatment of chronic diseases.
 
According to a news report in 2012,  75 out of 1000 babies born in the UAE suffer from a birth defect, which is mostly of genetic origin. Most scientists and researchers have attributed marriages between close relatives as the major cause of genetic disorders.
As per another news report of 2013, the UAE Genetics Diseases Association estimates that there may be more than  400 genetic diseases in the country. The report adds that genetic disorders are the fourth-highest cause of deaths in the UAE and that the UAE is ranked sixth among 193 countries in terms of prevalence of birth defects, mainly due to genetic causes.

 Centre for Arab Genomic Studies  aims to prevent genetic disorders in Arab countries by taking advantage of modern science and technology in human genetics. It does so by identifying disease-causing genes in the Arab population, raising public awareness about the diseases and addressing the ethical, legal and social issues that may arise from genetic applications besides achieving other complementing objectives.

In order to prevent further cases of genetic disorders or other disorders arising in offsprings of marriages between close relatives and transmission of contagious diseases,  a pre-marriage mutual check is mandatory  for residents and citizens who wish to get married in the UAE.

                            The UAE is keen on providing accessible healthcare services to people of determination (persons with disabilities or special needs). Federal Law No. 29 of 2006 Concerning the Rights of People with Special Needs protects the rights of people of determination (people with special needs) and guarantees them the right to live with dignity. Article 2 of the law provides: A person's special needs shall not be a reason to deprive him/her of their rights and services especially in welfare as well as social, economic, health, educational, professional, cultural and leisure services.
 
Emirates Health Services - EHS  issues a medical card to people of determination entitling its holder to receive free medical services through EHS. Similarly, Ministry of Community Development (MoCD) also offers a card entitling people of determination to free health insurance and medical glasses for children of such cardholders.
 
Zayed Higher Organization for People of Determination (ZHO) offers assessment and evaluation of mental, psychological, social health of people of determination in order to diagnose the type and the level of disability/limited ability by using certified global standards. It also offers hippo-therapy sessions with the purpose of developing multiple skills and functions such as sensory integration, underdevelopment, sensory perception and balance. 
 
In the emirate of Abu Dhabi, if there is a medical emergency for people of determination, you can get help by sending an SMS to 5999. You are required to send information about the incident, location of the patient and a phone number on which the police can contact you.
 
Community Development Authority too offers a card to people of determination entitling them to several medical facilities and services.
 
Dubai’s Health Facility Guidelines 2019 (PDF, 200KB) covers specific requirements for healthcare facilities to ensure that they are safe and functional for staff, patients and everyone else including the people of determination. The section on ‘Access, Mobility, Occupational Health and Safety and Security’ of the guidelines specifies standards in the fields of:

    Space 
    Human engineering
    Ergonomic considerations
    Accessibility requirements
    Signage guidance
    Safety and mobility considerations for floors, grab rails, doors, windows."

These digital solutions include the treatment by using virtual reality technology to help understand schizophrenia and to learn more about the suffering of patients with this disease, through the use of Gear by Oculus technology.
 
In addition, MoHAP, represented by the Specialized Care Department of Hospitals Sector, and in collaboration with Sharjah Roads & Transport Authority, organised awareness lectures in English and Urdu to raise Sharjah taxi drivers’ awareness about mental disorders. A medical team from MoHAP conducted examinations for 100 drivers to assess their acquaintance with mental disorders causes and treatment. The team distributed mental-disorders-related brochures including how to control these disorders and the places where drivers can go for diagnosis and treatment.
 
The Mental Health Program at Abu Dhabi Public Health Center aims to develop projects and provide resources to promote community mental health and reduce self and social stigma around mental disorders and associate treatment.
 
 
To support the spreading of awareness of mental health, reduce stigma and end discrimination against those with mental illness within the UAE, Al Jalila Foundation awarded three Emirati journalists, the ‘Mental Health Journalism Fellowship’. The fellowship promotes the publication of quality discussion around mental illness encouraging awareness and acceptance to a stigmatised hidden condition.

This amount will be added to the monthly water and electricity bill of the tenant. 
 
In Dubai, landlords must register lease agreements with RERA's online portal, Ejari. Tenants must pay housing fees to Dubai Municipality, which is calculated at the rate of 5 per cent of the yearly rental charges. The housing fees are added to the monthly electricity and water bills. 
 
As per local Law No. 43 of 2013 of Dubai, rental increases in the emirate can be applied when compared with the average rent in the area as per RERA increase calculator.
 
In Sharjah, lease contracts are registered with Sharjah Municipality.

                            In 2006, Abu Dhabi initiated the planning of Masdar City. The master plan of Masdar included major components such as:

    optimisation of solar energy through maximising efficiency gains
    integration of all aspects of city life by providing minimal use of transportation
    limiting height of construction and buildings
    providing high quality of life in an efficient ecosystem and environmentally smart way.

 
Masdar City represents the first attempt in the Middle East to build a sustainable city. Masdar City aims to reduce the use of energy, water and generation of waste. It uses a combination of technology, architectural designs and solar power to run. Using minimum energy is one of its primary steps to conserve the environment.
 
For example, the use of low-flow showers and smart water metres ensure reduction of water wastage. The architecture of Masdar City ensures that streets and houses are cooler than they would be otherwise. In addition, the use of high-efficiency appliances conserves energy.
 
Masdar City houses the headquarters of International Renewable Energy Agency, an intergovernmental organisation that supports countries in their transition to a sustainable energy future."

Dubai’s Smart City project adopts a strategy that calls for the transformation of about 1000 government services which focus on six key sectors namely: transportation, infrastructure, communications, economic services, urban planning and electricity. Dubai implemented many initiatives on the above six sectors, which fall under these categories:

    open and easy access to data
    smart transport
    optimising energy resources
    smart parks and beaches
    police smartphone apps
    new master control room.

 
Another initiative for smart cities transformation in Dubai is to incorporate all government bodies and turn them into a single entity, in order to provide comprehensive services to customers in an easy and efficient manner. Currents projects within this initiative involve using smart applications and devices across three tracks:

     Smart life, which deals with health, education, transport, communications, public utilities, and energy services
     Smart economy, which deals with developing smart companies, port services, smart stock exchanges, smart jobs
     Smart tourism, which deals with providing a smart and convenient environment for visitors to the emirate, including visa, flight, smart gates, and smart hotel services.

                            The UAE is largely an arid land with vast sand deserts, but is also characterised by sand dunes, oases, rock mountains, valleys, marshes and mangroves and salt plains.

The oases are mostly of date palms; most oases are located in the emirate of Abu Dhabi.

Along the eastern borders are the Hajjar Mountains that run north-south. These mountains are complemented by valleys (called wadis in Arabic). The wadis are usually dry. However, in cooler months when it rains, they flourish with brooks and pools.

Mangroves (called qurms in Arabic) form an integral part of the marine ecosystem.

Salt plains (called sabkhas in Arabic) are also a common feature. The present-day sabkha started to form some 4000 years ago."

                            The UAE's natural environment is diverse with four major varieties of ecosystems:


    desert ecosystem
    
    mountain ecosystem
    
    coastal and marine ecosystem
    Wetlands ecosystem.

 
Desert ecosystem

Desert is the dominating landscape, stretching from the southern coast of Arabian Gulf to the uninhabited sands of the  Empty Quarter (Rub Al Khali). To the east is the gravel plains bordering the  Hajjar Mountains.
 
Mountains ecosystem

Hajjar's rugged mountains rise sharply to an elevation of 2000 metres. Wadis or dry riverbeds open out onto fertile plains.
 
Coastal and marine ecosystem

The UAE's seas are home to a variety of fish, invertebrates and other marine animals. The southwest waters of Abu Dhabi and Marawah Marine Biosphere Reserve in Abu Dhabi, Jebel Ali in Dubai and Sir Bu Na'air Island and Khor Kalba in Sharjah are recognised by the UAE for their rich and unique environmental biodiversity and are of global biological and ecological importance. The marine habitat protects beaches from coastal erosion and plays a role in climate change mitigation.

Natural habitats of marine organisms are governed mostly by the type of surface, tides, water current, degree of wave exposure, temperature and salinity.
The marine life of the UAE is rich in fish, plants and corals. Over 500 different species of fish inhabit the Gulf waters, with many more existing in the Indian Ocean.

The Arabian Gulf is blessed with large populations of dugongs, dolphins (eight species) and marine turtles. The green turtle (Chelonia mydas) is the most common and feeds on the extensive sea grass beds found in shallow waters. Both green and hawksbill (Eretmochelys imbricata) turtles are known to nest on the beaches of UAE's main coast and islands.

Coral reefs and mangrove creeks are habitats for many marine creatures. These areas are important fish breeding grounds and feeding areas and they protect the shores from coastal erosion.

Damage to coastal developments, fishing nets, anchors and ignorant divers cause destruction of these areas. Coral reefs are sensitive to their environment. They take decades to regrow.

Dominant marine life forms in the UAE coasts include fish, marine mammals and marine reptiles.
 
Fish

At the entrance to the Arabian Gulf, the constriction and resultant strong currents of the Strait of Hormuz, influence the distribution of many species.

 
Marine mammals

Marine mammals are relatively common in the UAE's waters and include a great diversity. The two groups of marine mammals that are represented here are the whales and dolphins of the order Cetacea, and  dugong  of the order Sirenia.
 
Marine reptiles

These include sea turtles and sea snakes.
 
Sea turtles

Of the seven recognised species of marine turtles in the world, four live in the waters of the UAE. They are:


    The  green turtle  (Chelonia mydas)
    
    The  hawksbill turtle  (Eretmochelys imbricata)
    
    The  loggerhead turtle  (Caretta caretta)
    
    The huge  leatherback turtle  (Dermochelys coriacea)
    
    The olive ridley sea turtle (Lepidochelys olivacea)
    

 
Sea Snakes

Sea Snakes are found in the UAE's seas. There are at least seven species, all of which belong to one family, the Hydrophiidae. They are excellent swimmers and the laterally flattened tail makes them easily recognisable and distinguishes them from eels.

The UAE's coasts

The UAE has two coastlines. The longer coast, at over 700 kilometres, excluding islands, faces in a north to north-westerly direction into the southern Arabian Gulf whilst the other, much shorter, coast, approximately 70 kilometres long, faces eastwards into the Gulf of Oman.

Much of the Arabian Gulf coastline is low-lying, flat and bordered by shallow water. While the coast of Gulf of Oman is rugged and eroding, with a higher proportion of hard rock.

The differences in climate along the two coasts has led to assemblages of marine organisms that are somewhat different, although both are of Indian Ocean origin.
 
Wetlands
The UAE has 10 sites designated as Wetlands of International Importance, Ramsar sites, with a surface area of 39,166 hectares. Some of these are:

    Al Wathba Wetland Reserve, Abu Dhabi
    Bul Syayeef, Abu Dhabi
    Jebel Ali Wetland Sanctuary, Dubai
    Ras Al Khor Wildlife Sanctuary, Dubai
    Mangrove and Alhafeya Protected Area in Khor Kalba, Sharjah

                            Gheras 
In order to preserve its biodiversity and protect and restore the natural habitats of its local plants, the UAE created a database of local plant species and made it available to the public. . An app titled Gherasuae is available on App Store and Google Play. 
In 2014, the UAE's Ministry of Climate Change and Environment  completed the first phase  of its date palm tree identification through DNA profiling through a collaboration with the UAE University.
The projects aims to offer all kinds of support to preserve, identify and classify all genetic assets of date palm trees. It also aims to establish a reference database for all types of palm trees found in the UAE, as well as identify and document the extent of their diversity. The project will also help increase the contribution of palm tree planting and date production to the country's gross domestic product.

In addition, many initiatives were launched to preserve the UAE's plant species, including the establishment of 'gene' banks for plants' genetic resources. One initiative will be implemented by Environment Agency - Abu Dhabi (EAD), which is set to document and preserve plants through establishing Abu Dhabi Plant Genetics Resources Centre. The purpose of the centre is to collect and document native plants so that if any species became extinct in the wild it could be cultivated in captivity and reintroduced back to nature.

AQI monitors and analyses air quality and produces calculated forecasts to drive data-informed decision-making and strategies that reduce air pollution.
 
AQI forecasts the air quality status for up to three days in advance and predicts the concentration of dust and particulate matters with a diameter of less than 2.5 microns. AQI calculations are based on the measurements of five main pollutants:

    Nitrogen dioxide (NO2)
    Carbon monoxide (CO)

                            The National Air Quality Platform uses the Air Quality Index (AQI) platform to provide real-time data on the quality of the air in the UAE. It displays information received from 31 air pollution monitoring stations across the UAE. You can check the air quality in each area, learn about the health risks associated with each level of air quality and decide if a certain area is suitable to visit depending on the quality of air. 
 
National Center of Meteorology shares the information on air quality with the authorities to help them develop policies on air pollution control. This information enables researchers and academicians to study the impact of environmental factors, industrial progress and population density on air quality.

                            The UAE’s Green Barjeel Research project aims to leverage innovative methods to grow microalgae biomass with a high lipid content in tower-shaped structures. The project involves collecting algae from the UAE’s desert ponds and cultivating them. The process offers lot of benefits, including sequestering CO2 and removing dust particles from the ambient air to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants. The structures can serve as passive cooling systems for use in public spaces.


The project also seeks to examine and classify the diverse indigenous algal strains and test the potential of using them to produce biofuel and biofertilizers. The scope includes an experimental study on the safe and sustainable removal of Nitrogen oxides (NOx) and Sulfur oxides (SOx) from the atmosphere.
 
The first model of the Green Barjeel Research station is located in the garden of Ministry of Climate Change and Environment office in Dubai. The station is equipped with sensors that collect a series of environmentally sensitive data, such as ambient temperature, water temperature, oxygen and carbon dioxide levels for monitoring and displaying it on an electronic smart board."

                            Ministry of Climate Change and Environment
 Ministry of Climate Change and Environment  is the federal authority for environmental planning and action in the UAE. In collaboration with the competent local authorities concerned with environment, it works on developing environmental programmes and initiatives that aim to contribute to the sustainability of water, enhance food security, raise the rates of bio-security and enhance environmental security. The action plans of the ministry emerge from its vision to ensure sustainable environment for life.
  
The ministry launched National Climate Change Plan of the UAE 2017–2050 (PDF, 3 MB) which serves as a roadmap to bolster nationwide actions for climate mitigation. Through this plan, the UAE will further strive to be at the frontline of global efforts to prove that climate action can go hand in hand with continuous economic development. The document serves as a complementary plan of action that specifically addresses climate change.

                            Environmental awareness aims at developing the culture of the society regarding environment and promoting environmental behaviour of individuals, which helps to conserve and properly manage natural resources.

The bodies concerned with the environment protection organise educational campaigns at the emirate or federal level in coordination with the respective federal agency. 
The type and slogans of these campaigns are based on the needs of the UAE's community in the areas of environmental awareness and education.

In recent years, environmental education has become one of the salient elements in curriculum development in the United Arab Emirates. Accordingly, efforts have been directed to include environmental content in school curricula and textbooks.

Therefore, Ministry of Education has been keen to incorporate the environmental dimension in school curricula of all stages, by addressing the environmental issues that affect student's environment, in order to open the way for discussion on sustainable solutions.

As part of the involvement of global stakeholders in the wheel of promoting environmental knowledge, the  Eco-Schools Initiative was launched. It is a global initiative led by the Emirates Wildlife Society in collaboration with the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), aiming to encourage environmental action in schools.

It was launched to facilitate Dubai-based individuals and companies who have creative projects to start a campaign through the platform and ask the UAE’s community to fund their business idea and turn it into a venture. 
 
DubaiNEXT is based on the ‘All-or-Nothing’ model, where a campaigner sets a fundraising goal, but keeps nothing unless the goal is achieved. After the campaigner meets his funding goal, the amount will be released to him through Dubai SME. If the campaign does not reach the funded goal, the contributed amount will be refunded to the contributors.
 
The campaigner will get to keep full ownership of his project. Contributors can choose from a variety of unique rewards offered by the campaign owner.
 
The ‘Dubai Next’ platform aims to encourage youth and start-ups to obtain community support through crowdfunding. It envisions to empower a generation that is capable of innovating to succeed in a competitive commercial environment, thus reinforcing the fundamental role of SMEs in economic development.

Measures to improve road safety encompass the framework frequently applied in accident prevention work, which contains four elements:


    enforcement
    
    education
    
    engineering
    
    emergency medical services.
    

 
Road safety audit

DoT of Abu Dhabi introduced a  road safety audit  to be completed for all new highway projects; this audit would cover the phases of design, construction and post-construction. The purpose of the audit is to identify road safety problems and to suggest measures to eliminate or mitigate any concerns.

Road safety awareness

 Road safety awareness was a programme launched by DOT of Abu Dhabi, which focuses on drivers, riders and pedestrians. The programme targets educating children and adolescents as future road users and drivers.

Central traffic control system 'SCOOT'

'SCOOT' is a central traffic control system installed with sensors counting the volume of vehicles at signals to improve traffic flow at main junctions. The sensors will detect the flow, the number of cars on each approach and the cruise speed or the average speed towards a traffic signal. This new adaptive traffic control system is used in both  Abu Dhabi  and  Dubai.

Speed management strategy of the emirate of Abu Dhabi

DoT of Abu Dhabi launched the speed management strategy of the emirate of Abu Dhabi with the objectives of:


    reducing road crash fatalities and injuries in the emirate of Abu Dhabi
    
    facilitating the safe and efficient movement of people whilst protecting and enhancing quality of life.
    

The strategy covers six major components:


    assessing the speeding problem
    
    engineering
    
    laws/legislation
    
    education and awareness
    
    enforcement
    
    stakeholder coordination.

Dubai traffic safety strategy

Dubai traffic safety strategy is set to establish a challenging record of reducing fatalities to 1.5 for every 100,000 of the population in Dubai by 2021.

The strategy is based on four agendas:


    improving motorists' driving habits
    
    inspecting vehicles for traffic safety regulations and for criminal safety procedures
    
    inspecting motorists' records
    
    traffic awareness campaigns.
    

Haseb

In 2008, Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) launched  a major safety campaign that will go for life under the slogan  Haseb  (take care in Arabic). The campaign highlights safety issues on roads, in transportation, at construction sites, at sea and other safety behaviours.

Based on accident statistics of 2007, the campaign recognises seven key causes of road accidents, which include excessive speeding, use of handheld mobile phones, fatigue, not keeping enough distances between vehicles, not wearing seatbelts, lack of lane discipline and jumping red signals.

                            In 2012, Dubai Police introduced the ‘White Points’ system to motivate those driving cars to abide by traffic laws and regulations. Under the White Points system, people with a driving licence issued by the Dubai Government will be rewarded if they do not:

    commit any traffic violations in Dubai or other emirates
    incur Salik and parking fines 
    face traffic prosecution cases for an entire year.

 
White points are accumulated at the end of the year, at the rate of two points per month. Eligible drivers would gather 24 points in one calendar year.
 
White points entitles the driver to one of the following rewards, once, during one calendar year:

    exchanging traffic white points with traffic black points for a maximum of 12 points
    cancelling the impoundment of the vehicle for a period of 30 days maximum
    cancelling a traffic violation that is clear of black points or impoundment period
    cancelling the payment for the extra impoundment period for 30 days maximum."

                            Telecommunications and Digital Government Regulatory Authority (TDRA) in cooperation with Abu Dhabi and Dubai Police launched an eCall system for automatic call in the event of traffic accidents. 
 
In the event of a collision, the eCall system automatically establishes a two-way voice communication via the cellular network to the nearest emergency centre. The emergency centre will dispatch a medical team to the location of the accident as soon as possible.
 
This system will accelerate the accident response time by providing a sophisticated feature for rapid communication with the emergency teams, which allows automatic and voice information to be received and logged into the system simultaneously rather than printing commands in a conventional manner."

                            Road toll in Dubai (Salik)
All vehicles including taxis are subject to a toll of AED 4 when they pass through the toll gates in Dubai. Vehicle owners are required to buy salik tags which are available online and at petrol stations. After purchasing the salik tag, vehicle owners must stick them on the front shield of their car/bike. Check the salik balance from time to time by calling on 800-Salik (80072545) and re-charge it online. Read about additional top-up channels.

    Sheikh Zayed Bridge
    Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Bridge
    Al Maqtaa Bridge
    Mussafah Bridge.

 
Activation of account on the toll system
If you own a vehicle or vehicles, you must set up and activate your account with ‘Darb’, the toll gate system, through the website of Darb or the ‘Darb’ mobile application available on App Store, Google Play and AppGallery.
 
Vehicles will be automatically identified by their plate number; you don’t need to stick a tag on the windshield.
 
Toll amount

    A toll of AED 4 will be levied on every vehicle passing the gate during peak hours that will be 7 am to 9 am and from 5 pm to 7 pm from Saturday to Thursday
    No fees will be levied during off-peak hours, and on Fridays and official holidays

    Senior Emiratis, People of Determination, Emiratis with limited-income and retired Emiratis are exempted from paying the toll; the exemption is limited to one vehicle.
    The toll system will automatically exempt these categories from paying toll if their vehicles are registered in Abu Dhabi.
    Owners of vehicles registered in other emirates must log into their accounts to claim exemption.

Tourist visas through agencies and hotels
Licensed travel agents and hotels in the UAE can arrange a tourist visa for you provided you purchase the ticket through them and maintain hotel reservation with the specific hotel.
You can also contact travel agencies in your country for any tourist packages available to the UAE in collaboration with a local tour operator.
It is important to check the authenticity of travel agents you are dealing with and refrain from paying or sending copies of your official documents until after you are 100 per cent sure the tour operator is genuine. You can seek the help of the UAE embassy in your country for verification.

Anti-bullying
The ‘Addressing Bullying in Schools:Training Manual’ (PDF, 242 MB) has been developed to assist schools in addressing bullying of students. It aims to empower schools with effective techniques for educating students about bullying and equipping them with attitudes and social skills that significantly reduce the likelihood of bullying. It also covers the roles and responsibilities of teachers, school counsellors, social workers and parents when they encounter instances of bullying and offers them practical guidance, based on research on bullying prevention and intervention.
 
The UAE’s Supreme Council for Motherhood & Childhood in cooperation with UNICEF, Ministry of Education and Department of Education and Knowledge in Abu Dhabi launched the Guide for parents on anti-bullying (PDF, 120 KB). This guide will help parents identify if their child is a victim of bullying, or if he is bullying others and what can be done to stop it.

                            Federal Law No. 3 of 2016 concerning child rights, also known as Wadeema's Law (PDF, 250 KB), stresses that all children must be provided with appropriate living standards, access to health services, education, equal opportunities in essential services and facilities without any kind of discrimination. The law protects children against all forms of negligence, exploitation, physical and psychological abuses.
In addition, smoking in public and private vehicles and indoor facilities where children are present is also prohibited under the law. Violators will be subject to penalties as set out by the law.
The law allows childcare specialists to remove children from their homes against parents' wishes and without judicial permission in cases of imminent danger. In less severe cases, specialists may intervene by visiting the child regularly, providing social services and mediating a solution between the family and the child.

Those who put children in danger, abandon them, neglect them, leave them without supervision, do not enroll them in school or register them upon their birth will be subject to a prison sentence or a fine or both. The law applies to all children up to the age of 18."

The resolution will be applied to all existing residences and those to be built. Owners of existing houses have been granted three years from the issuance of the resolution to install the fire detecting devices.
 
It also stipulates that the federal or local government departments concerned with issuing licences for the construction of residential homes must ensure that fire detectors have been installed and the owner has subscribed to the eSystem, before granting a completion certificate.
 
The federal and local governments will bear the costs of installing these devices in the homes of people with limited income. The federal government had previously covered these costs for homeowners who receive social assistance from Ministry of Community Development.
 
Ministry of Interior, through Civil Defence Departments, will carry out the provisions of the resolution and cooperate with all parties concerned to facilitate its implementation."

The regulation seeks a trusted digital environment throughout the UAE.
 
The IA Regulation provides management and technical information security controls for entities to establish, implement, maintain, and continuously improve information assurance. TDRA will designate the critical entities as per the UAE CIIP Policy to implement the IA Regulation and apply its requirements to the use, processing, storage and transmission of information or data, and the systems and processes used for those purposes. This includes information in physical or electronic form that may be owned, leased, or otherwise in the possession, custody, or control of the entities.
 
In particular, the IA Regulation provides:

    description of how information assurance is achieved at the national, sector and entity levels
    a risk-based approach for the implementation of the IA
    an outline of the roles and responsibilities of key stakeholders for the planning, development, implementation and ongoing monitoring and improvement of IA
    a reference catalogue of common information security controls to defend against common threats that exploit known cyber security vulnerabilities
    a realisation for sectorial requirements through the provision of specialised controls to address sector-specific information assurance requirements
    a phased implementation approach to address the most common threats, facilitate the incremental adoption of IA and optimise the value realised through implementation of IA
    a definition of compliance from the perspective of IA and describes the approach that will be adopted by TDRA to assess compliance
    an enabler for inter-entity and cross-sector communication to support information sharing and build national situational awareness.

                            The UAE maintains digital security of individuals through the UAE Pass app and Emirates ID. 
 
The UAE Pass app
The UAE Pass app is the first national digital identity and signature solution that enables users to identify themselves to government service providers in all emirates through a smartphone-based authentication. It also enables users to sign documents digitally with a high level of security. The app is available on iTunes and Google Play.

 
Emirates ID
Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs and Ports Security (ICP) succeeded in launching electronic identity cards for the whole population in the country including nationals and residents. The card carries biometric details of the holders an, in order to verify and confirm the identity of each individual through the personal number and the smart card related to the biological features of the individual.
ICP issues Emirates ID card to registered people. The card has several uses. It can be used as an identity proof to get government services, for voting in the elections of Federal National Council, as a travel document for UAE citizens to travel within the GCC and as a document to pass immigration through the eGates and smart gates at several airports in the UAE. Further, the identity card is designed to reinforce security for its holders, guarding them against fraud and illicit transactions. Read about the Emirates ID’s features and benefits and how to apply for an Emirates ID."

                            What is an eSignature?
An eSignature is used in electronic messages to identify the signatory (the sender of the message) and distinguish them from everyone else. An eSignature also proves that the message received is the same message that was sent by the signatory and that nothing has been added, deleted or amended. It may consist of letters, marks, symbols, numbers, sounds or images. 
 
An eSignature is as binding as a signature executed by hand. Federal Decree by Law No. 46 of 2021 on Electronic Transactions and Trust Services (PDF, 4.4 MB, available in Arabic only) approves the use of eSignatures in the UAE. To create an eSignature, you need an electronic signature creation device, and a digital certificate to be authorised to use this device. Certification services providers issue digital certificates. These certificates confirm the identity of the signature device holder.
 
What is a digital certificate?
A digital certificate is a certificate issued by a certification service provider, which confirms the identity of the person or entity holding an electronic signature creation device. An electronic signature creation device is a uniquely configured device or electronic information that enables a person to apply his e-signature in the form of electronic keys and symbols.
 
What is a digital certification service provider (DCSP)?
A digital certification service provider is an accredited or authorised natural person or legal entity that issues digital certificates and offers digital signature-related services.
 
How to apply for a DCSP license?
You can apply for a DCSP license through Telecommunications and Digital Government Regulatory Authority (TDRA). Obtaining a licence from TRA is required for all digital certificate service providers operating in the UAE with respect to eRecords, eDocuments and eSignatures related to eTransactions and/or eCommerce. To apply for a DCSP licence, you need to submit the following documents to TRA:

    your company’s memorandum and Articles of Association
    details of your company’s organisational and ownership structure
    the commercial licence authorising you to act as a DCSP
    a statement of your commercial activities
    details of the company's accounts and financial resources for the previous two years (or less if your company has been trading for less than two years)
    an insurance policy which shows you have sufficient cover for your activities as a DCSP.

 
Digital signature and timestamp service
Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs & Port Security (ICP) offers digital signature and timestamp service. The service enables entities and individuals to sign documents and transactions digitally using their ID card, with a timestamp on the signature that shows the date and exact time of the signature. The timestamp cannot be changed or altered even by the owner of the digital signature which gives undisputed accuracy of document and transaction creation and updates.
 
ICP Validation Gateway-VG
To simplify the usage of the Emirates ID card and its certificates, ICP set up a Validation Gateway (VG). VG enables governments, organisations as well as individuals to make use of the Emirates ID card in an online scenario. The VG is a service available online that offers a wide variety of digital functionality related to the Emirates ID card. After approval from ICP, users can connect to the VG and perform online services using the Emirates ID cards for authentication and signing.

                            Ministry of Interior and the National Programme for Happiness and Wellbeing launched the ‘Child Digital Safety’ initiative in March 2018, in a joint effort to raise awareness among children and school students about online threats and challenges, and promote a safe and constructive use of the internet. 
 
The initiative also familiarises parents and educators with solutions they can use to address these challenges and ensure the safety of their children and students. It includes developing educational material on digital safety, facilitating children with global best practices in that domain, and providing advice to parents and teachers to enhance digital safety for their children at home and in the learning environment.
 
Four sub-initiatives to enhance digital safety of children 
This initiative consists of four main sub-initiatives. They are: 

    Interactive Children’s Camp, where children between 5 and 18 years can learn how to use the internet and social media safely 
    Digital Wellbeing Portal, which provides tools and information to help parents face the challenges of the digital world
    training workshops, where parents and teachers can be trained to address digital challenges and threats and
    a support platform to answer urgent queries from parents regarding digital safety.

 
Protection of children's data online
Article 29 of Federal Law No. 3 of 2016 Concerning Child Rights, also known as Wadeema's Law (PDF, 250 KB), states: The telecommunications companies and internet service providers shall notify the competent authorities or the concerned entities of any child pornography materials being circulated through the social media sites and on the Internet and shall provide necessary information and data on the persons, entities or sites that circulate such material or intend to mislead the children.
 
In addition, the Dubai Data Law (Law No. 26 of 2015 on the Organization of Dubai Data Publication and Sharing, PDF 250 KB) aims for data protection and privacy of all individuals including that of children. 
 
The Sannif initiative was launched to enable parents to learn about eGames and assess their impact on their children. 
 
ITU’s Child Online Protection (COP) Guidelines
ITU launched the 2020 Child Online Protection (COP) Guidelines to ensure that the rights of children are being respected when they are online. The guidelines are the product of the collaborative effort of 80 experts from different sectors including governments, international organisations, NGOs, academia and the private sector.
 
ITU has developed specific guidelines for:

    children
    parents and educators 
    industry and
    policymakers.

 
In addition, ITU and its partners are in the process of launching training courses to educate everyone about children’s online safety.

In December 2012, UAE government launched the  Hedayah Centre (Arabic for guidance), which aims to counter violent extremism by promoting understanding and sharing of good practices for the global interest.

 
The Abu Dhabi Safety and Security Planning Manual

The  Abu Dhabi Urban Planning Council issued the  Abu Dhabi Safety and Security Planning Manual - (PDF, 43.5 MB) to develop safe, secure and sustainable communities by ensuring that safety and security aspects are included in the development proposals.

The SSPM is based on the belief that places that are not within common vision or easy sight prove to be a favourable place for crime to occur. The primary focus for the manual is to reduce crimes against the person through changes to the built environment. It combines the three disciplines of personnel, information and physical security in a manner to create 'defence in depth', where multiple layers work together to deter, delay, detect and deny an attack.

The SSPM includes a set of strategies and measures that seek to reduce the risk of crimes occurring and their potentially harmful effects on individuals and society, by intervening in the multiple influencing factors/causes.

For more information, read Abu Dhabi Vision 2030.

 
Higher Committee for Crises and Terrorist Acts Management (HCCTAM)

The emirate of Abu Dhabi established the Higher Committee for Crises and Terrorist Acts Management (HCCTAM). HCCTAM leads the emirate's efforts to counter terrorism and is the owner of the Counter Terrorism Strategy. This strategy is organised around a series of work streams, one of which is protection. The strategy seeks to increase the resilience of the UAE against attacks.

Community Protection Face Recognition initiative

To enhance the security of the UAE, Ministry of Interior deployed a  face recognition system  using advanced technology to protect the borders of the UAE, as well as its critical infrastructure and key assets. The system's biometric software scans images of individual faces for analysis and identification. It uses sensitive cameras to capture the faces of people. The cameras can scan and capture images of people standing near and far from the camera and whether in motion or standing still.

The UAE's smart initiatives to counter extremism and terrorism

The UAE Government advocates fighting extremism by stopping suspicious funding, disrupting the recruitment of foreign fighters, securing borders, preventing the exploitation of the web and social media and by contesting the use of religious centres to promote hatred and violence.

To this end, the government established the  Sawab Center  to restrict violent extremist messaging on the internet. The word Sawab in Arabic means doing the right thing. This online initiative counters false claims, highlights key activities conducted by the global coalition against extremists and amplifies credible voices to speak out against terror.

                            MoI uses the latest technologies to maintain security and boost productivity in police work. Some of them are:

The 'Falcon Eye' system

Abu Dhabi police utilises a complete central system, which called the falcon eye system. It covers Abu Dhabi city, Abu Dhabi International Airport, the main islands and the areas of Bani Yas and Musaffah.

The system receives a live feed from visual surveillance equipment installed on site and displays data in an integral system that provides warnings and enables quick access to events and incidents.

The system controls roads by monitoring traffic violations such as the use of hard shoulders, illegal parking and the misuse of roads and dealing with traffic accidents live.
 
IRIS system-Abu Dhabi Police

Abu Dhabi police uses  eye print system  to help identify persons by their iris patterns. It is based upon mathematical analysis of the random patterns visible in the iris of a person's eye (iris recognition). This system is effective, accurate and fast in detecting wanted persons and the process takes seconds to identify a person.
 
Driverless mini police cars
Dubai Police is considering launching autonomous, self-driving cars. The robotic vehicles will be equipped with biometric software to scan wanted criminals and those who are suspected of or are actually breaking the laws.
The driverless vehicles will patrol different areas including tourist destinations of the city to boost security and hunt for unusual activity, all the while scanning crowds for known criminals and potential persons of interest to police. It can recognise people in any area and identify suspicious objects and can track suspects. Police officers can access the car through their fingerprint.
The new security system is so advanced that the mini-vehicle even comes with its own drone, which can be launched via a rear sleeve — both are monitored and linked to Dubai Police command room.
  
Flying bikes
In October 2017, Dubai Police unveiled a model of a flying motorbike, Hoversurf. It can seat one police officer who would pilot the bike. However, it can also fly through remote operation. It is being considered for use during emergencies. 
 
Hoversurf works on electricity and can fly at five metres height. This feature is useful during emergencies and heavy traffic. The flying bike can travel up to a distance of 6 kilometres. It can fly for 25 minutes and can carry up to 300 kg of weight at a speed of 70 kmph."

    the presence of blacksmith shops that sell knives to teenagers
    
    the receipt of fraudulent text messages by mobile phone users.


    Al Najeed Service from Sharjah Police
    

Sharjah Police introduced the Najeed service. Through this service, you can report information and tip-offs about crimes or any other threats posing danger to the stability of society.

                              Federal Law No. 6 of 2014, Concerning the National Military Service and Reserve Force aims to instil values of loyalty and sacrifice in the hearts of the citizens to defend the achievements and gains of the Federation, push forward the wheel of development and protect the homeland, its borders, its resources and gains and national security and stability.
According to the law, the service may be completed at the UAE Armed Force, Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Interior, State Security Service and other institutions identified by the Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces.

In addition, citizens who complete the mandatory military service will enjoy a range of benefits, including priority for taking up jobs in government institutions and private businesses, marriage grants, housing plots and scholarships.

The terms of the UAE national service

According to Federal Law No. 6 for 2014 on National Military Service and Reserve Force as amended, it is mandatory for all medically fit Emirati men to accomplish the national service after obtaining the approval of National and Reserve Service Committee of UAE Armed Forces' General Command.
According to the law, the service is optional for women, regardless of their education.
Pursuant to Resolution No.15 of 2022  to amend some provisions of Resolution No.6 of 2016 Regarding the Amendment of the National Service Period, the national service term for male recruits holding a high school diploma or its equivalent and above has been shortened to 11months, and for those who didn't complete their high school, the term will be three years.
According to the resolution, the duration of national service for female recruits is 11 months.
 
What the employers need to know

Working Emiratis will not be exempt and while serving in the military, time will be added to their end-of-service and pension benefits.

Federal and local departments, as well as private sector businesses will be obliged to allow their Emirati workers to enlist for military service. They also have to keep their jobs or similar jobs open for them once they complete the service. Their positions can be filled on a temporary basis until they have completed their services.

Failing to enlist for the national service

Citizens who fail to enlist for military service without valid reason until they reach 29 years of age will face a jail term of one month to one year, or a fine ranging between AED 10,000 and AED 50,000 or both. They will have to undergo the military service even if they exceed the age limit of 30.

Postponing the national service

The national service can be postponed only if a person:


    is less than 29 years old and is enrolled in a university, college, institution or training centre for a course the duration of which is two years or more
    
    has obtained a minimum of 90 per cent grade average or better in their General Certificate of Secondary Education
    
    reaching 18 years old and has not completed secondary education, provided the person is continuing morning classes education.
    

Alternative service

As an alternative, those who do not meet the conditions for performing national service can do administrative, civil or technical jobs according to their capabilities and for the same duration of service.

Exemption from the national service

The sole son of a family and medically unfit citizens can be exempt from military service. Those who sustain their parents or siblings with special needs and those serving jail terms would benefit from a temporary exemption.
Once the reason for temporary exemption is over, those people have to report to the authorities to undergo the military service.

                            The UAE Government is keen to have its community informed about the laws and the judicial system. A number of initiatives were launched to increase the level of legal awareness in the society, which include:

Meezan magazine

The UAE's Ministry of Justice issues 'Meezan', a monthly issue about the UAE's judicial developments, legislations and awareness campaigns.
 
Tweeter Visit

Launched by Dubai Courts,  Tweeter Visit  aims to open new communication channels with various sectors of society in an efficient way. It invites residents to have a tour so they can be introduced to the UAE's legal system. Participants will have the opportunity to meet judges and other court staff and ask them about the nature of their jobs and the challenges they face.

 
 Suhail services 
For any assistance, customers can connect with Dubai Courts throgh online chat or WhatsApp number: +9714-3347-777.
 
Smart Court campaign

Dubai Courts launched a  Smart Court campaign  that invited Dubai Government staff as well as lawyers, legal experts and students of law to send their suggestions on ways to improve its service through the court's 'Nebras' smartphone application. The move was promoted using the slogan: Your Suggestions Make the Future.
 
Law Respect Culture Bureau

The UAE's Ministry of Interior established a special department called 'Law Respect Culture Bureau'. This department aims to promote a culture of respecting the law and public order in the society. The Bureau uses the most common languages spoken in the country to inform different sectors in the society about the relevant effective laws.
 
Establishment of Judicial Training Institure 
Judicial Training Institute was established in 1992 as a federal entity. It has contributed in promoting the competency of the judicial system. The institute prepares and qualifies graduates of Shariah or Law Schools to hold judicial posts in the country.

It organises courses for judiciary members on various legal themes and judicial technicalities, in addition to training courses for preparation and qualification of notaries public, judicial aides and lawyers. It also offers training for government bodies' personnel, whose jobs are related to law and judicial fields, as well as, scientific research and its usage within the law and judicial fields.

 
Raising children's legal knowledge

Juvenile offences make up a significant percentage of all cases examined by prosecutors in the UAE. Studies showed that juveniles tended to carry out crime because of a low level of awareness about the seriousness of such misdemeanours under the law. The offences were often committed on the spur of the moment. By teaching youth about the law at an early age, youngsters will be more likely to turn into responsible adults.

Abu Dhabi Judicial Department (ADJD) had declared 2015 as 'child's legal knowledge year'. The initiative aimed at teaching youngsters about their legal responsibilities. The campaigns included short videos about wrong actions and their damaging results, like one who fights in school, uses the mobile phone to insult others or causes disturbance.

T","","","Inclusive education for people of determination
                            The UAE has made tangible efforts to include people of determination in mainstream education. These efforts are reflected in the Ministerial Resolution No. 647 for the year 2020 on the policy of inclusive education (PDF in Arabic, 500 KB), which directs government schools to adapt themselves to cater to the needs of people of determination and provide them with the best education services. 
 
Additionally, the ministry established the People of Determination Department (formerly known as the Special Education Department), in 2008 to protect the rights of students of determination and provide them with equal opportunities as other students. The ministry also provides all supporting services (mentioned below) to students of determination for free in government schools.
 
The ministry provides specialised teachers with high behavioural skills that enable them to care for people of determination. It also launched several skill training programmes that include clear instructions on dealing with people with visual and hearing impairment. It launched programmes for teachers to identify talents, understand sign language for those with hearing difficulties, and know how to properly deal with language disorders experienced by children.
 
The ministry has established support centres across the UAE to follow up on the progress of students of determination before and after inclusion within schools. These centres provide different services such as diagnosis of students with disabilities and learning difficulties, providing recommendations, assisting parents in dealing with their child's condition, and advising support services suitable for their children.
 
Services and facilities for students of determination
The schools are required to provide the following facilities for students of determination:

    wheelchair ramps and elevators, toilets, buses, cars and parking spaces prepared for students with physical disabilities
    special education resource rooms and sensory and comprehensive rooms 
    specialised human cadres such as: special education teacher, teacher assistant, escort, sign language interpreter, Braille education specialist, visual impairment specialist, psychologist, speech and language specialist, special education specialist
    assessment and diagnosis of students of determination by a multidisciplinary team
    support services and individual and group treatment and rehabilitation sessions, according to their needs such as speech and language sessions, Braille education sessions, behaviour modification sessions, sign language sessions
    counselling, awareness and guidance sessions for parents of students of determination
    devices and assistive technologies according to their special needs
    workshops and courses for administration staff, teachers, guides, specialists and parents of students.

Note that workshops are conducted for students of both, public and private schools.
 
In addition, schools must support students of determination by engaging them in all activities of the ministry such as prize awarding, competitions and programmes inside and outside the UAE such as the “Our Ambassadors” program.

Caring about students of determination during the COVID-19 crisis
The ministry continued to provide support to students of determination during the pandemic of COVID-19 through distance education platforms such as Microsoft Teams, Al-Diwan, etc.). Exams were conducted electronically. A sign language interpreter was provided to the students. Remote assessment, diagnosis and treatment sessions too continued. 
 
Dubai Inclusive Education Policy Framework
In support of the ‘My community… a city for every one’ initiative and Dubai Disability Strategy 2020 which aims for Dubai to become disability-friendly by 2020, Knowledge and Human Development Authority - KHDA launched the Dubai Inclusive Education Policy Framework (PDF).
 
The framework provides valuable information about the standards required in the area of educational practice and offers clear guidance on the actions to be taken to ensure the provision of quality inclusive services for students of determination (disabled or people with special needs).
 
The framework applies to all education sectors across Dubai. It includes early childhood services, special needs centres and primary, secondary and higher education providers. It also empowers education providers, regulatory authorities and governing bodies in Dubai to closely monitor progress and compliance.
 
Equal opportunities
MoE offers several training programmes and facilities targeting children of determination, their parents and kindergarten teachers.
Programmes include guidance for dealing with people with visual and hearing disabilities, talent identification programmes, getting familiar with sign language for the deaf and handling speech and language disorders in kindergarten-going children.
Support centres
Ministry of Education has set up support centres to follow up and evaluate the progress of people of determination before and after integration in schools. These centres provide various services including individual diagnosis of students with disabilities and learning difficulties, recommendations, helping and supporting parents to deal with the child's situation and directing them to sources with appropriate support services for their child.
National institutes concerned with people of determination can benefit from annual grants and rewards and professional programmes for qualifying experts in the field of special education.
Community Development Authority (CDA) offers tuition assistance in cash up to AED 50,000 per year to low-income earners with children that have disabilities.

                            In 2018, Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation (MoHRE) implemented a new rule which allows the companies to recruit skilled workers from inside the country or from abroad under part-time contract system. These types of contracts are limited only to skilled workers, namely holders of university degrees or higher and those who completed two or three years diploma in any technical or scientific field.
Under this new system, part-time contract employees can take several part-time jobs without the approval of the original or other secondary employers; however, they are obligated to take permit from the MoHRE.

    Start with an impressive cover letter and an honest CV.
    
    Keep your CV updated.
    
    Be diligent and regular in searching. Do not give up mid-way.
    
    Check for the email ID from which you receive job offers. It should reflect the domain name of the organisation.
    
    Do not pay. If the hiring company or the agency asks you for money to process the visa or medical test, it is not a genuine company.
    
    Learn Arabic. Knowledge of Arabic (at least speaking) would be an advantage.
    
    Keep yourself updated about your field of work.
    
    Be realistic about your earning potential.
    
    Grow your network.
    
    Increase your general knowledge about the region and its social and cultural value system.

                            Channels for reporting work injuries and occupational diseases
Firms report work-related injuries and occupational diseases to Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation (MoHRE). Reporting can be done through any of the following channels: 

    the digital system for MoHRE’s services 
    business service centres, which are approved by MoHRE 
    the MoHRE’s app on App Store and Google Play
    other channels specified by MoHRE. 

 
In case of an injury or death at workplace, the employer/s must inform MoHRE within 48 hours from the incident.
 
Obligations of the employer
Establishments with 50 or more workers must have a special system for monitoring work injuries and occupational diseases. The system should include:

    a record of work-related injuries and occupational diseases 
    necessary preventive tools and training programmes for workers engaged in high-risk activities 
    an inventory of all activities that are dangerous to the health and safety of workers 
    number of workers performing hazardous jobs 
    a mechanism to: 
    
        carry out health examination of workers engaged in hazardous activities 
        report incidents of work injuries and occupational diseases within the firms 
        investigate incidents of work injuries, occupational diseases and necessary measures to protect other workers 
        ·obtain a report from the competent medical committees that shows the level of disability in the event of a work injury or occupational diseases 
    
    
    a log for periodic medical examination of workers 
    a record of workers exposed to occupational hazards for a period of not less than 5 years after the termination of their service. 

 
Additionally, the employer should: 

    provide the worker with proof of his employment in the firm performing such a hazardous job 
    inform the medical authorities as soon as becoming aware of the occurrence of a work injury or suspecting an occupational disease
    report immediately to the competent police station, in the geographic location of the firm, any work injury or occupational disease.

Compensation for work injuries and occupational diseases
An employer is obligated to treat and compensate an injured worker for any work-related illness or injury. The compensation is paid according to the provisions stipulated in Article 37 of Federal Decree Law No. 33 of 2021 Regarding the Regulation of Employment Relationship, and its amendments (PDF, 918 KB). 
 
The worker receives compensation within a maximum period of 10 days after the release of the medical report indicating the percentage of disability as illustrated in the schedules annexed to Cabinet Resolution No. 33 of 2022 Concerning Work injuries and Occupational diseases (PDF, 478 KB). 
 
Amount of compensation
If the work injury or illness results in the worker’s death, the compensation is equal to the basic wage of the worker for 24 months, provided that the compensation amount is not less than AED 18,000 (eighteen thousand) and not more than AED 200,000 (two hundred thousand). The compensation amount is calculated according to the basic wage that the worker was receiving before his death. The compensation is paid to his/her legal heirs, or as the worker otherwise specifies.
 
If a worker sustains a permanent complete disability, the compensation will be equal to the amount due in the event of death.
 
If a worker sustains a partial disability, he/she will be compensated with a portion of the value of permanent complete disability.
 
For more information about reporting and handling work injuries and occupational diseases, refer to the Ministerial Resolution No. 657 of 2022 on Rules and Guidelines to Deal with Work Injuries and Occupational Diseases (PDF, 733 KB).
